# Database Modelling with Rick And Morty API

In this simple project, we modeled a database with diagrams such as Entity Relationship Diagram and build it with SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) commands. The API consumed to populate the database was disponibility by Axel Fuhrmann in [The Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).

I applied some concepts of databases such as database modeling diagrams, SQL statements, API consumption, scripts to process data and insert it into the database.
